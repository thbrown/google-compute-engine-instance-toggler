Google Compute Engine Instance Toggler

A Node js webserver that allows anybody online to start or stop a Google Cloud Engine instance via browser.
Wrote this because I was tired of texting my friend to ask him to turn on the Minecraft server, but you can use it for whatever.

Setup:

In the GCP web console in your browser:
1) Create auth key for exteranl applications
search for API, click Credentails
create new service accout key
download key file and rename it to cred.json (you'll need this in a sec)

On the computer you want to run the server on:
1) Clone this repo.
2) Install Node js.
3) Edit config.json to include your values for project, zone, and instance.
4) Replace the cred.json in the cloned repository with the one you downloaded above.
5) Build (npm install)
6) Run node server.js
7) Use
open on port 8001 by default
localhost:8001

Notes:
This will proably be much more useful to you if you have some script that runs your stuff automatically on startup in your GCP instance. Something like...
