Google Cloud Platform Compute Instance Toggler

A Node js webserver that allows anybody online to start or stop a Google Cloud Compute instance via browser.
Wrote this because I was tired of texting my friend to ask him to turn on the Minecraft server, but you can use it for whatever.

Setup:

In the GCP web console in your browser:
1) Create auth key for exteranl applications
search for ''
add key
download key file and rename it to cred.json (you'll need this in a sec)

On the computer you want to run the server on:
1) Clone this repo.
git clone this
cd this
2) Install Node js.
apt-get node.js
download from '' if on windows
3) Edit config.json to include your values for project, zone, and instance.
4) Replace the cred.json in the cloned repository with the one you downloaded above.
5) Build.
npm install
5) Run.
sudo chmod +x
./server.js
6) Play.
open on port 8001 by default
localhost:8001


Notes:
I like to run this on the on a Google Cloud Platform micro instance, since (as of this writing) one of these instances is included in the free usage tier.

This will proably be much more useful to you if you have some script that runs your stuff automatically on startup in your GCP instance. Something like...
